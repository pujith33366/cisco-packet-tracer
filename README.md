## Cisco Packet Tracer Network Topologies

This repository contains a collection of network topology designs created using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
The goal of this project is to understand and implement different types of network topologies and configurations using routers, switches, and end devices.

🌐 Unified Hybrid Topology with a Central Router
I created a hybrid network design where a single router acts as the central point connecting three different types of network topologies: Tree, Star, and Ring.

Each topology is independently structured with its own set of switches and end devices, but all are connected to one central router, enabling seamless communication across the entire network. This setup simulates how real-world networks often integrate multiple topologies to balance performance, reliability, and scalability.
