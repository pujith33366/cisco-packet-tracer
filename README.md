Cisco Packet Tracer Network Topologies
This repository contains a collection of network topology designs created using Cisco Packet Tracer. The goal of this project is to understand and implement different types of network topologies and configurations using routers, switches, and end devices.

ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Inside
ðŸ”· Types of Network Topologies

  Bus Topology
  Star Topology
  Ring Topology
  Mesh Topology
  Tree Topology

ðŸ”· Router Configurations

  Basic router setup
  IP addressing and subnetting
  Static routing
  
ðŸ›  Tools Used
  Cisco Packet Tracer (latest version)

ðŸ“š What I Learned

  Designing and simulating various network topologies
  Configuring routers and switches
  Assigning IP addresses and subnet masks
  Establishing communication between different network devices
  Analyzing packet flow and connectivity in different network layouts
